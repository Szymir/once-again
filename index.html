		<h1>Danger Danger - I Don't Need You</h1>
		<p>Lose my number, forget may name
		Keep all my shit just go away
		You suck me dry, leaving me numb
		I curse the day I whispered
		You're the one, the one, the one
		I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
		You're poison in my veins, acid in my rain
		Like a bullet in my brain
		I don't need you</p>
		<p>You haunt me like a house
		You're bad taste in my mouth
		Like a stain hat won't come out
		I don't need you, I'm trippin' day-glo
		I'm dead inside
		You're kisses taste like suicide
		You're not my habit
		I'm not your whore
		I'll kick you cold
		I won't be crawlin' back for more</p>
		<p>Broken skin, velvet tongue
		Dogtooth violet kiss the sun
		You were deaf and I was... dumb</p>
